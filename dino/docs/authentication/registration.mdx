# User Registration

This page describes the user registration process in detail.

## Form Fields

The registration form includes the following fields:

- **Name:** The user's full name (minimum 2 characters).
- **Email:** The user's email address (must be a valid email format).
- **Password:** The user's password (minimum 8 characters).
- **Confirm Password:** Must match the password.

## Validation

The form uses [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for both client-side and server-side validation.  If any of the fields are invalid, error messages will be displayed next to the corresponding input.

## Server Action

When the form is submitted, the `register` Server Action (defined in `app/actions.ts`) is called. This action:

1.  Validates the input data on the server-side (using Zod).
2.  Creates a new user account in Supabase using `supabaseClient.auth.signUp`.
3.  Creates a user profile in your database (if you have a `profiles` table - this is optional).
4.  Redirects the user to the login page.

**Note:** Email verification is currently *simulated*.  No actual verification email is sent.
