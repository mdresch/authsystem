# Authentication Overview

This section provides a detailed overview of the authentication features in this project.

## Features

- **User Registration:**  Users can create new accounts with a name, email, and password.
- **Login:**  Registered users can log in with their email and password.
- **Password Reset:**  Users can reset their password if they forget it.
- **Email Verification (Simulated):** Email verification is currently *simulated*.  No actual verification email is sent.  To implement real email verification, you would need to integrate with an email service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun, Resend) or use Supabase's built-in email functionality.
- **Protected Routes:**  Certain routes (like the dashboard) are only accessible to logged-in users.

## Technologies

- **Supabase Auth:**  Used for user management and authentication.
- **Next.js Server Actions:** Used for secure server-side logic.
- **Zod:** Used for form validation.
- **PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange):** Used for enhanced security in the password reset flow.
